The goal is to uncover relationships between these data points to drive strategic decision-making in sales, marketing, and product development.

### Data Sources
This project integrates multiple datasets for a complete sales overview:
* `Devang- Sales Analysis Project.xlsx - FNP.csv` (Could represent sales data for a specific entity or region, e.g., "Flowers N Petals")
* `Devang- Sales Analysis Project.xlsx - Customers.csv` (Customer demographic and possibly behavioral data)
* `Devang- Sales Analysis Project.xlsx - Orders.csv` (Transaction-level order details)
* `Devang- Sales Analysis Project.xlsx - Product.csv` (Product catalog information)
* `Devang- Sales Analysis Project.xlsx - Sheet1.csv` (Likely the main working sheet or output summary)

### Tools & Technologies
* **Software:** Microsoft Excel
* **Key Excel Features/Functions:**
    * Advanced Data Linking & Integration (using `VLOOKUP`, `INDEX MATCH`, `XLOOKUP` for combining data from different sheets/tables)
    * Power Query for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) if complex data shaping was required.
    * Complex Formulas for calculating KPIs like Average Order Value, Customer Lifetime Value, Sales Growth.
    * Interactive Dashboards with Slicers and Timelines for dynamic filtering and reporting.
    * What-If Analysis (e.g., Data Tables, Goal Seek) for scenario planning.
    * Data Visualization (various chart types to represent sales trends, customer distribution, product mix).

### Key Analysis and Insights (Examples)
* **Overall Sales Trends:** Analysis of total sales revenue and quantity sold over time (monthly, quarterly, yearly).
